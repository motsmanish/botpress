## Pre-built Binaries

You can download the binaries [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/botpress-binaries/index.html).

## Building from source

**Prerequisites**: Node 10.11 (you can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)) and Yarn.

1. Run `yarn` to fetch node packages.
1. Run `yarn build` to build the core, the UI and the modules.
1. Run `yarn start` to start the server.

### Building issues

If you encounter errors when building modules (timeout, random errors, etc), try the following:

1. Go in each module folder and type `yarn && yarn build`

## Documentation

### Developer's Guide

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/en/) to create the Developer's Guide.

- To start the development server, run `yarn start:guide`
- To generate the static files, run `yarn build:guide`. The generated files will appear under `/docs/guide/build`
- To deploy a new version of the documentation, run `yarn run version <version here>`

### SDK Reference

We use [TypeDoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc) to generate the SDK Reference directly from the source code.

- Run `yarn build:reference` to generate the documentation. The static files will appear under `/docs/reference/public`.
